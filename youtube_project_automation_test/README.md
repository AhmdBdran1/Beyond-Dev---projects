# Automated Testing for YouTube Website

This project aims to automate tests for the YouTube website using Selenium and Python. The tests are structured following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, enhancing maintainability and reusability.

## Overview

YouTube is a widely-used video-sharing platform, and automated testing ensures its functionality remains intact across various features and interactions.

## Tools and Technologies

- Selenium: Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. It allows us to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and perform various testing tasks.
- Python: Python is a versatile programming language with rich libraries and frameworks, making it ideal for automation tasks.
- Page Object Model (POM): POM is a design pattern used to create an object repository of web elements. It promotes code reusability and enhances test maintenance.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main directories:

- **infra**: Contains infrastructure-related code, such as configuration files, drivers, or any setup required for testing with Selenium.
- **logic**: Consists of the core logic of the application, including page objects, utilities, and helpers.
- **test**: Houses the test scripts responsible for simulating user interactions and verifying functionality.

## Test Scenarios

The tests cover various scenarios and interactions on the YouTube website, including searching for videos, navigating through channels, playing videos, and interacting with comments and subscriptions.

## Running Tests

Ensure you have set up your Selenium environment and configured the necessary parameters in the `infra` directory.
