# Automated Testing for 365 Scores Website

This project is aimed at automating tests for the 365 Scores website using Selenium and Python. The tests are structured using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, enhancing maintainability and reusability.

## Overview

365 Scores is a popular sports website offering live scores, news, and updates across various sports. Automated testing ensures the functionality of the website remains intact as new features are added or modifications are made.

## Tools and Technologies

- Selenium: Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. It allows us to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and perform various testing tasks.
- Python: Python is a versatile programming language with rich libraries and frameworks, making it ideal for automation tasks.
- Page Object Model (POM): POM is a design pattern used to create an object repository of web elements. It promotes code reusability and enhances test maintenance.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main directories:

- **infra**: Contains infrastructure-related code, such as configuration files, drivers, or any setup required for testing.
- **logic**: Consists of the core logic of the application, including page objects, utilities, and helpers.
- **test**: Houses the test scripts responsible for simulating user interactions and verifying functionality.

## Running Tests

Tests can be executed either serially or in parallel based on the configuration setup.
